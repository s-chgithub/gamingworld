It was the first console to use Blu-ray Disc as its primary storage medium. The console was the first PlayStation to integrate social gaming services, including the PlayStation Network, as well as the first to be controllable from a handheld console, through its remote connectivity with PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita.<br>

The PlayStation 3 development began in 2001 when Sony announced a collaboration with Toshiba and IBM to the Cell microprocessor. Sony officially unveiled the PlayStation 3 console to the public on May 16, 2005, at E3 2005.<br>

PlayStation 3 launched with 14 titles. After the first week of sales, it was confirmed that Resistance: Fall of Man from Insomniac Games was the top-selling launch game in North America. As of March 31, 2012, there have been 595 million games sold for PlayStation 3. The best selling games are Grand Theft Auto V, The Last of Us, Gran Turismo 5, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception.<br>

During its early years, the system was receiving negative reviews, due to its high price, $599 for a 60-gigabyte model and $499 for a 20 GB model. A big problem was also the complex processor architecture, and the lack of quality games, but that was praised for its Blu-ray capabilities and “untapped potential”. The system had a slow start in the market but managed to recover, particularly after the introduction of the Slim model.<br>

The slimmer version of the PlayStation 3 features an upgradeable 120 GB, 160 GB, 250 GB or 320 GB hard drive and is 32% smaller, 36% lighter and consumes 34% less power than the previous model.<br>

The Cell microprocessor has moved to a 45 nm manufacturing process, which makes it cooler and quieter than any previous model, redesigning the cooling system too. The RSX moved to a 40 nm process in the latest revision.<br>

The PlayStation 3 Slim no longer had the ‘main power’ button like the original console, similar to the PlayStation 2 Slim version. After the backward compatibility was not featured on the Slim version, Sony announced a new series of PlayStation 2 remasters, called Classics HD, including PS2 and PSP titles remastered in HD.</p><br><h1 align=center>PlayStation 3 Superslim (2012)</h1><p align=center><img src=ps3superslim.jpg></p><p align=center><table id=t3><tr><th>CPU:Cell Broadband Engine 8-core – 3.2 GHz<br>

The console came out on the market with the availability of either a 250 GB or 500 GB hard drive. One of the obvious changes was the sliding disc cover, instead of the traditional slot-loading drive.

In look, shape, and design, the Super Slim version resembles something of a hybrid between the Slim and the original PlayStation 3. The console is much smaller, measuring 11.4 inches wide by 2.36 inches tall by 9.05 inches deep, 20% smaller and 25% lighter than the previous Slim console.

Beyond its smaller size and storage capacities, the Super Slim model doesn’t feature anything else. A vertical stand was also available for these models and launched on the same day as the consoles in their respective regions.</p><Br><p align=center><embed src="ps3vid.mp4" height="480" width="854"></body></html>
