Each company released their consoles based on various strategies to attract the gamer. <br>

The early builds of the Xbox 360 had many hardware failures caused by overheating. The three flashing red lights and the well known Red Ring of Death was a common inconvenience for the owners. These early models forced Microsoft to repair and replace every system and even extend the consoles’ warranties for all of the issues.<br>

A series of massive exclusive hit titles like Crackdown, Gears of War, Dead Rising and Mass Effect helped to keep the people loyal on the console. The Xbox Live service and its subscription were expanded, redesigned and contained most of the Xbox 360’s console bundles, but the prices where aggressively high. That was a big disadvantage for Microsoft, especially when Sony announced that their players can enjoy the online experience without paying any subscription.<br>

Microsoft redesigned Xbox 360’s hardware several times, alongside it with a bunch of peripherals like the redesigned wireless controller and headset followed by one of the biggest Microsoft’s releases, the Kinect. A device that is based on the webcam-style add-on peripheral, enabling users to control and interact with their console using gestures and voice commands.</p><br><h1 align=center>Xbox 360 S (2010)</h1><p align=center><img src=xbox360s.jpg></p><p align=center><table id=t3><tr><th>CPU & GPU: Custom ATI-designed, combo single chip<br>

A  slim, lighter and freshly looking design with a glossy black finish and a smaller power brick were more than enough for players to give a second chance on the Xbox 360 brand.

The S model was built with a more powerful processor and motherboard in order to reduce the hardware failures and thermals issues that the original Xbox 360 had.  The console was replaced with physical power and eject buttons with touch-system and offered HD-DVD drive, Ethernet, WiFi connection and two additional USB ports.</p><h1 align=center>Xbox 360 E (2013)</h1><p align=center><img src=xbox360e.jpg></p><p align=center><table id=t3><tr><th>CPU: IBM custom designed Xenon – 3 cores<br>

The Xbox 360 E was slightly smaller, lighter and quieter than the S model, and it was built for players who were unwilling to spend money for the upcoming Xbox One. The design is similar to the Xbox One console with its inter-cooler design, the black matte color, and the gloss finish. <br>

The designers rolled back to the physical power and eject buttons and removed the AV connector making it an HDMI only video connection.
