Sales of the console, games, and accessories pulled in $250 million on the first day, beating the $97 million made on the first day of the Dreamcast.<br>

The hardware uses the Emotion Engine CPU, a custom-designed processor based on the MIPS architecture with a floating-point performance of 6.2 GFLOPS, and the custom-designed Graphics Synthesizer GPU, with a fillrate of 2.4 gigapixels/second, capable of rendering up to 75 million polygons per second.<br>

Software for the PlayStation 2 was distributed primarily on DVD-ROM, with some titles being published on CD-ROM. Also, the console can play audio CDs and DVD movies and is backwards compatible with almost all original PlayStation games. The PlayStation 2 also supports PlayStation memory cards and controllers, although original PlayStation memory cards will only work with original PlayStation games and the controllers may not support all functions, such as analogue buttons, for PlayStation 2 games.
<br>
Some of the following titles were released exclusively for the console, Grand Theft Auto, Final Fantasy, and Metal Gear Solid. Some of the most popular series started from PlayStation 2, such as Kingdom Hearts, God of War, and Devil May Cry. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was the best-selling game on the console. Some games on the PlayStation 2 support online multiplayer gaming through the use of a broadband internet connection and a PlayStation 2 Network Adapter.<br>

The PlayStation 2 initially sold well and made a great success based on the PlayStation brand, as well as, the console’s backwards compatibility feature. Announced in 1999, the PlayStation 2 offered backward compatibility for its predecessor’s DualShock controller, as well as for its games. The PlayStation 2 is the best-selling video game console of all time, having sold over 155 million units worldwide. Over 3,800 game titles have been released for the console, with over 1.5 billion copies sold.</p><br><h1 align=center>PlayStation 2 Slim (2004)</h1><p align=center><img src=ps2slim.jpg></p><p align=center><table id=t3><tr><th>CPU: MIPS R5900 (64-bit) – 294 MHz<br>

In September 2004, Sony unveiled its third major hardware revision. In late October 2004, a smaller, thinner, and quieter slim version of the PlayStation 2 was released, including a built-in Ethernet port. Due to its thinner, the slim version does not support the internal hard disk drive. It also lacks an internal power supply and has a modified Multitap expansion. <br>

At the beginning of 2005, it was found that some black slimline console power transformers manufactured between August and December 2004 were defective and could overheat. The units were recalled by Sony and replaced by a 2005 model.<br>

In July 2007, Sony started shipping a revision of the slimline PlayStation 2 featuring a reduced weight of 600 grams compared to 900 grams of the previous slim version, achieved through a reduction in parts. The unit also uses a smaller motherboard as well as a custom ASIC which houses the Emotion Engine, Graphics Synthesizer, and the RDRAM. The AC adaptor’s weight was also reduced to 250 grams from the 350 grams in the previous revision.
