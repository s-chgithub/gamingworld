Originally released in Japan back on December 12, 2004, the PSP was Sony’s first handheld system. At the time of its release, Nintendo was already dominating the market with their Game Boy Advance and the Nintendo DS. However, the coming of the PSP was Sony’s answer to Nintendo, as not only did it compete against the latter but also against other competitors such as N-Gage and Gizmondo. <br>

Thanks to the massive support from third-party developers, the PSP boasts a fantastic library of video games to dig into. Similar to the PS2, the games’ library is diverse, brimming with a variety of fantastic genres such as JRPG, Hack and Slash, Beat’em Up, and especially Racing.</p><br>
