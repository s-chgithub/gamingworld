At the time, the sixth-generation console market was overwhelmed by PlayStation 2, GameCube and Dreamcast, leading Microsoft to rise through a very competitive marketplace, and people were wondering if the Xbox console would be an expensive mistake. They proved everyone wrong by selling 550,000 units of hardware in its first week. <br>

The console’s prototype was put together at first as a side project, using Dell laptop parts and then Microsoft decided to redesign it. This led Xbox to use the PC’s x86 architecture, a build that was very rare for a console at the time. Microsoft engineers originally called the console “DirectX Box“, named after the DirectX graphics technology, that was developed for PC gaming and later was shortened to Xbox.<br>


Xbox was the first console to have a built-in Ethernet port, combined with a broadband connection. It was the time were Xbox Live launched and Microsoft offered to players a unique, steady and reliable online experience, but only with a subscription.<br>


One of the biggest hits for Xbox was Halo, a science fiction first-person shooter game, developed by Bungie, with smooth and balanced gameplay followed with its sequel in 2004 were more-than-enough reasons to buy an Xbox. Many other exclusive titles followed like Ninja Gaiden, Fable and Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, which helped a lot the franchise to succeed.</p><br>
