Announced in February 2013 the critics were praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers’ needs, embracing independent game development, and not imposing the restrictive digital rights management schemes like those originally announced by Microsoft for the Xbox One.<br>

The console features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit built upon the x86-64 architecture, which can peak at 1.84 teraflops. AMD stated that it was the most powerful APU it had developed to date. Its optical drive is capable of reading Blu-ray Discs at speeds of up to three times that of its predecessor. The original PS4 console can output in 4K and play multimedia in the format but does not play games in 4K resolution. The console includes a 500 GB hard drive for additional storage, which can be upgraded by the user. <br>

The console’s controller was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 3, with improved buttons and analog sticks, and an integrated touchpad among other changes. The console also supports High-dynamic-range video and playback of 4K resolution multimedia. The shape of the triggers and shoulder buttons were refined, the D-pad buttons were given a steeper downward angle to provide a resting space in the center for the user’s thumb, and the handgrips were made thicker and given micro texturing to improve their feel.<br>

Sadly, the PlayStation 4 is not compatible with any game of the older PlayStation consoles. PlayStation 4 games are distributed at retail on Blu-ray Disc, and digitally as downloads through the PlayStation Store.

PS4 allows users to access a variety of free and premium PlayStation Network services, to play online on multiplayer games, including the PlayStation Store access, giving its player up to three games per month for a limited time to play.<br>

By the end of September 2019, over 102 million PlayStation 4 consoles had been shipped worldwide, surpassing lifetime sales of the PlayStation 3.</p><br><h1 align=center>PlayStation 4 Slim (2016)</h1><p align=center><img src=ps4slim.jpg></p><p align=center><table id=t3><tr><th>CPU: AMD Jaguar 8-core – 1.6 GHz<br>

The addition of 5GHz WiFi was added, and a UHD Blu-ray drive.<br>

Like the original PlayStation 3 and the PS3 Slim model, the PS4 Slim retains the overall shape of the PS4, with a glossy black synthetic and a textured matte finish. This makes it much less prone to collecting dust, fingerprints, and scratches. The sharp corners have changed into softer and rounded.<br>

The power and eject buttons have been replaced with physical buttons. The power button is larger, while the eject button is in the shape of a circle. The power button also acts as a replacement for the color-changing LED strip that adorned the top of the original PlayStation 4.</p><h1 align=center>PlayStation 4 Pro (2016)</h1><p align=center><img src=ps4pro.jpg></p><p align=center><table id=t3><tr><th>CPU: AMD Jaguar 8-core – 2.1 GHz<br>

<br>
The Pro design is a complete copy of the original PS4 console, there are a lot of similarities such as the flat parallelogram. Although, the Pro version is a little wider and a little taller than the original, and a bit heavier, too.<br>

DualShock 4 was changed too, adding a light bar built into the touchpad, with a feature where you can see instantly which player you are by the color, but more importantly, the triggers have been tweaked and it feels lighter in the hand.<br>

This new strategy by Sony, releasing a Pro version of its new console led to increasing the total player base and making another great success on sales, by also releasing exclusive games that would take advantage of the console’s.</p><Br><p align=center><embed src="ps4vid.mp4" height="480" width="854"></body></html>
