The console, which goes on sale this November 19 in Europe (a week earlier in the United States and Japan), will be accompanied by a wireless controller full of changes compared to the DualShock 4.

As we will see below, it is a command with dimensions of 160mm x 66mm x 106mm and a weight of 280 grams.

In this case, unlike the PS4 DualShock, which had between 800 mAh and 1000 mAh (depending on the age of the model), this time we will find a controller with 1560 mAh, so that it is expected that the autonomy will be much greater . The price of the DualSense separately will be in Europe of 69.99 euros.</p>
