<p align=center><h2 align=center>Unreal Engine enables game developers and creators across industries <br>to realize next-generation real-time 3D content and experiences with <br>greater freedom, fidelity, and flexibility than ever before.</h2></p><p align=center><font size=10>The world's most<br> open and advanced <br>real-time 3D creation tool</font></p><h1 align=center>HERE IS A GLANCE AT UNREAL ENGINE 5</h1><br>

<p>
<table><th><img src=ur1.png><th><h2>Leverage game-changing fidelity</h2><br>
Bring incredibly immersive and realistic interactive experiences to life<br> with <br>groundbreaking new features like Nanite and Lumen that <br>provide a generational leap in visual fidelity, and enable worlds to be fully dynamic.</tr>
<tr><th><img src=ur2.png><th><h2>Build bigger worlds</h2>
Think big, really big.<br> Unreal Engine 5 provides the tools and assets you need to create truly expansive worlds for your players, participants, <br>and stakeholders to explore, using content that scales.</tr><Tr><th><img src=ur3.png><th><h2>Animate and model in context</h2>
New artist-friendly animation authoring, retargeting, and runtime tools together with a significantly expanded modeling toolset reduce iteration and eliminate round-tripping, speeding up the creative process.</tr>
<tr><th><img src=ur4.png><th><h2>Faster, easier, more efficient <br>
Unreal Engine 5 gets a UI makeover!</h2>

With Quixel Bridge now fully integrated,<br> you have drag-and-drop access to the entire Megascans library. <br>It s part of the new Create menu for acquiring content and creating and placing Actors.<br>

To free up space in the viewport,<br> you can now easily summon and stow the Content Browser and dock any editor tab to a sidebar.<br> Plus, it s faster to find the properties you re looking for in the Details panel.<br></tr>
<tr><th><img src=ur5.png><th><H2>Massively detailed</h2>
Create games and worlds with massive amounts of geometric <br>detail with Nanite, a virtualized micropolygon geometry system,<br> and a new Virtual Shadow Map system.

Directly import and replicate multi-million-polygon <br>meshes while maintaining a real-time frame rate without any noticeable loss of fidelity.<br>

These systems intelligently stream and process only<br> the detail you can perceive, largely removing poly count and draw call constraints.</tr>
<Tr><th><img src=ur6.png><th><h2>Dynamic global illumination and reflections</h2>
Lumen is a fully dynamic global illumination<br> and reflections solution that enables indirect lighting to adapt on the fly<br> to changes to direct lighting or geometry for example, changing the sun s angle with the time of day or opening an exterior door. 

With Lumen, you no longer have to author lightmap UVs,<br> wait for lightmaps to bake, or place reflection captures; <br>what you see inside the Unreal Editor is what you get on console.</tr>
<tr><th><img src=ur7.png><th><h2>Quality or performance?<br> Why choose?</h2>
Players of next-generation consoles expect<br> frame rates of 60 fps or more on high-resolution displays, <br>putting an enormous strain on rendering resources.

Temporal Super Resolution (TSR), a built-in,<br> platform-independent, high-quality upsampling system, enables the engine<br> to render at much lower resolution but with similar output<br> pixel fidelity to frames rendered at a higher resolution.</tr>
