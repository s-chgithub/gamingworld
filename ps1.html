</tr></table></p><div><p id=p1>Six years later, a redesigned, slim version was released under the name PS One, having the same hardware specifications. They replaced the original grey color with white and named it appropriately to avoid confusion with its successor, PlayStation 2. It was the highest-selling console through the end of the year, outselling all other consoles, including Sony’s own PlayStation 2.

The PS One is fully compatible with all PlayStation software, but compatibility with peripherals may vary. The PS One model also had additional changes, including the removal of the parallel and serial ports from the rear of the console, and the removal of the reset button. Sony also released a version with a 5? LCD screen compatible with the console, calling it a Combo pack.

The last PS One consoles were sold at the end of 2006 shortly after it was officially discontinued, for a total of 102 million units shipped since its launch eleven years earlier and less than a year before the debut of the PlayStation 3.</p></div><br>
