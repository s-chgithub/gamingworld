</th></tr></table></p><p id=p1>The Xbox Series X released in November 10, 2020, and promises extreme specifications, similar to PlayStation 5’s. 4K (8K ready) gaming with 120 FPS? I’m not gonna lie, this is “impossible” even for a beast gaming PC, let alone a console that costs 10 times less. <Br>

But of course, games are optimized differently for consoles, leaving out a lot of the “details” that make rendering very hard for GPUs, while keeping the visual result almost identical. Offering 12 Teraflops of power, the Series X is almost double in capabilities than Xbox One’s best edition. <Br>

1TB of SSD storage space is also a big upgrade, as it’s going to be the first time Microsoft uses an SSD for optimal gaming performance. The “box” design of Series X has been criticized a lot – both negatively and positively – but what is important (at least to me), is that this design also offers amazing cooling capabilities.<Br>

As we all know, heating is a big issue with consoles and high-performance AAA games, so Microsoft has put a lot of R&D into many components of the console, in order to ensure top cooling performance, that’s also optimized to be as quiet as possible.</p><Br>
